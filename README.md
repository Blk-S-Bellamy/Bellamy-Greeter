### Installation
To add a bash greeter, add the greeter to the home directory with the name ".greeter", then in the appropriate file (usually .bashrc) add the line ```bash $HOME/.greeter```

## Notes
A primary focus of this greeter is using low latency commands in order to maximize efficient time usage. While it is visually appealing, there are no issues with waiting for a particular command to run before printing.
